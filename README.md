# Cheatsheets standards format

## Why we need a standard format for cheatsheets.
There are various sources where best of the best cheatsheets are available.
Still when I need to search for something relevant either there are too many results or no results.
Searching and understanding the thought process of how the cheatsheet is created takes a lot of time.
There are some tools that are very good at giving those results.

I have listed some of the best cheats sheets i can find. As you go through them You will notice none of them any kind of common formats.
Most of the use markdown. some of them use images pdfs etc. Only few of them have the functionality to search among the cheatsheet fastly.

Hence I think there is a need to decide and drive this standard format for this cheatsheets.
